    Alison Knowles’s The House of Dust is among the earliest computerized poems, consisting of the phrase “a house of” followed by a randomized sequence of 1) a material, 2) a site or situation, a light source, and 3) a category of inhabitants taken from four distinct lists.
    
    1. Create two to four lists of words or phrases. Each list should have some sort of theme, or be similar in some way. As a guiding principle, each list should have 5+ items to start. Your lists should be separate in some way (in theme, purpose, or structure).
    2. Write the formula for selecting a random element from an array. Use string interpolation to swap out one of the words in the poem for a randomly selected element from your list.

    Hint: Formula for selecting a random element from an array
    let randomElement = arrayName[Math.floor(Math.random()*arrayName.length)];

    3. Write a function that logs the randomized poem to the console.
        -- console.log()

    4. Invoke (call) the function to run the poem.

    5. Check the console for the result.
    6. [Bonus] Write the poem to the browser window using document.write()

    Sample Poem: // A house of steel / Among high mountains / Using candles / Inhabited by people who sleep almost all the time.

                    The <strong>Orinoco Mining Arc</strong> in Venezuela is a large-scale mining project that has raised concerns due to its significant impact on natural ecosystems and indigenous communities. This initiative, spanning an area rich in biodiversity, has led to deforestation, habitat destruction, and contamination of water sources. Protected areas and watersheds are particularly affected, disrupting delicate ecological balances. Indigenous people, who rely on the land for their livelihoods, face displacement and the loss of their traditional way of life. Additionally, the mining arc has witnessed illegal mining activities, further exacerbating environmental degradation and posing serious threats to both the environment and the well-being of local communities. This webpage aims to highlight these issues, shedding light on the consequences of the mining arc on protected areas, watersheds, and the indigenous population.

                                        <p>Mercury pollution from gold mining can have significant and far-reaching impacts on freshwater ecosystems and the freshwater fish industry. Mercury is often used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore. The process involves amalgamation, where mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials to form a gold-mercury amalgam. Unfortunately, this practice leads to the release of mercury into the environment, with serious consequences for aquatic ecosystems and the organisms that inhabit them, including freshwater fish.

                                        <p> Mercury from mining is getting into the soil and water, exposing local indigenous people to dangerous levels. The Orinoco river, which many indigenous communities rely on for water, is now contaminated with this toxic mercury used in gold extraction. Tests in mining areas of Bolivar state showed over 90% of mine workers had unsafe levels of mercury in their urine, affecting 87% of women and 68% of children. In the Caura river basin, 92% of indigenous women had elevated mercury levels, which can harm the brain, kidneys, and fetal development.
